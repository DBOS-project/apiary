smux.py <session_spec_file>

The format of session_spec_file consists of ini-style parameters followed by
lists of commands delimited by lines beginning with '---'.  

Any line starting with a # is considered a comment and ignored.

Currently there are two supported parameters.

PANES_PER_WINDOW, 
   The number of panes that each window will be carved into

LAYOUT, 
   One of the five standard tmux layouts, given below.
   even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, tiled.

Sample Input File:

   # This is a comment
   PANES_PER_WINDOW = 4
   LAYOUT = tiled
   ----------
   echo 'This is pane 1'
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | less
   ----------
   echo 'This is pane 2'
   cat /proc/meminfo 
   ----------
   echo 'This is pane 3'
   uname -a
   ----------
   echo "This is pane 4"
   cat /etc/issue
   ----------
