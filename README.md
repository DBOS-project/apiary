Welcome to Apiary!  Apiary is a transactional function-as-a-service (FaaS) framework for building
database-oriented applications such as microservices and web service backends.
Apiary provides an easy-to-use Java interface that supports general computation
and offers excellent performance, strong consistency guarantees,
and powerful new observability features such as automatic data provenance capture.
Apiary is an ongoing research project within the MIT-Stanford 
[DBOS](https://dbos-project.github.io/) collaboration;
we are interested in any feedback you can provide to improve the project
so it better meets developers' needs.

An Apiary application is composed of _transactional functions_,
which are regular Java functions that use SQL to access application state in a backend database,
but which execute as ACID database transactions.
We provide interfaces to write these functions, compose them into larger programs,
then schedule and run them.  Apiary provides three exciting features:

* High performance, especially in a distributed setting,
through aggressive co-location of compute and data.
* Strong consistency for programs, including exactly-once semantics for program execution 
and cross-function or even cross-application transactional guarantees.
* Data provenance capture for observability: we automatically record 
every function execution and every operation performed on data,
then store this information in easy-to query database tables to aid in
debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

Apiary currently supports two database backends: Postgres and VoltDB.
It can export provenance data to two systems: Postgres and Vertica.
We are open to supporting more databases in the future.

### Getting Started

To get started with Apiary, let's run a demo application:
a simple [social network](postgres-demo/)
built with Apiary and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
It requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

To set up the demo, let's first install some dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk maven libatomic1
```

Next, let's compile Apiary. In the Apiary root directory, run:

```shell
mvn -DskipTests package
```

Then, let's start Postgres from a Docker image. We recommend you [configure Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) so it can be run by non-root users.

```shell
scripts/initialize_postgres_docker.sh
```

To start the website, run in the `postgres-demo` root directory:
```shell
mvn clean && mvn package && mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, navigate to `localhost:8081` to view this new social network!
You should see its home page.

### Next Steps
If you want to learn more, we provide [a detailed tutorial](postgres-demo/README.md)
showing you how to build the demo social networking application.
We also have a [programming guide](ProgrammingGuide.md)
for Apiary as well as [documentation](https://dbos-project.github.io/apiary-docs/).

### Other Projects
This repository additionally contains source code for [Epoxy (VLDB 23)](http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf) and [R^3 (VLDB 23)](http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2761-li.pdf).  Detailed information on Epoxy is [here](Epoxy.md).  Detailed information on R^3 is [here](https://github.com/DBOS-project/apiary/tree/r3-exp).
